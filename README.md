# CryptocurrencyAnalysis

This repository contains a pdf presentation and a Kaggle Notebook , written in python, for a data science project that uses Unsupervised Learning techniques on a cryptocurrency dataset

#Project Overview

The aim of this project was to use data science and machine learning techniques to analyse data surrounding cryptocurrencies over a period of time. The datasets were taken the kaggle database, where Dataset A included historical data on attributes such as Average transaction fees, miners revenue, total value of block rewards and number of transactions, to name a few. 

Initially, there was no target variable to study. So data analysis techniques such as correlation matrices were used to find patterns and correlations between two variables.
